Welcome to the Operations Engineer Specialization Overview. We developed this course to meet the needs of operations specialists responsible for the design, installation, and management of Apigee Edge for private cloud. Over the next few minutes, we will go over the course structure and key topics we will be covering. The specialization is divided into multiple modules. We will begin by building a high level picture before moving into details. As part of the series, you will have the opportunity to learn about installation and upgrades, how to manage and secure Apigee, and scaling, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Each module is a combination of videos, reference material, and labs. The videos will explain a wide range of topics. The labs will guide you through specific step-by-step tasks. And the reference material provided here and at apigee.com will allow you to expand your knowledge beyond the topics covered in this series. So with that, I hope you enjoy the course.
