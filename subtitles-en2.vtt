00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
Hi everyone. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.575
you will receive an overview of the Apigee platform.

3
00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:11.080
APIs is allow you to connect applications to resources hosted on your back end systems.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.895
These APIs are deployed,

5
00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.920
and managed by an API management platform.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.665
A typical enterprise offers multiple connected digital experiences to their customers.

7
00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:25.675
These experiences are powered by a diverse set of applications.

8
00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.120
Applications range from mobile apps

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.270
to third party systems owned by partners or customers.

10
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.845
These applications often come with

11
00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:37.585
different requirements such as different types of data representation,

12
00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.450
different security models, and others.

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.260
Expectations around these connected experiences are driven by business oriented KPIs.

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200
These KPIs typically require agility,

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.710
faster time to market,

16
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.215
and tailored user experiences.

17
00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:56.525
On the other hand, we have back end systems.

18
00:00:56.525 --> 00:01:00.050
The SLAs of back end systems depend on high availability,

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.440
change control, and configuration management.

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.840
The gap between the expectations of connected digital experiences,

21
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.920
and back end systems often creates friction which

22
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.345
results in a slow pace of change and lack of agility in most organizations.

23
00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:20.510
This disconnect is often described as two speed IT.

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.910
Apigee helps to bridge the gap.

25
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.895
APIs is deployed on Apigee can be used to break

26
00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:30.445
dependencies between applications and back end systems.

27
00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.915
APIs represent products that need to be managed.

28
00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:39.455
Apigee provides both API runtime execution and API product management.

29
00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:43.620
Breaking dependencies between applications and back end systems through

30
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.150
API management with Apigee allows for faster innovation,

31
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.155
the creation of tailored user experiences, and greater agility.

32
00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:54.885
At the same time, Apigee provides the availability,

33
00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:58.860
scalability, and security that enterprises demand.

34
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.155
As we work to understand the role of an API management platform,

35
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:07.365
it is important to understand the types of interactions API facilitate,

36
00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:10.010
and the stakeholders of these interactions.

37
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.400
The Digital Value Chain captures these ideas.

38
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.395
We read the Digital Value Chain from left to right.

39
00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:20.960
Companies want to provide customers with connected user experiences.

40
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.835
These connected experiences are powered by applications.

41
00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:27.235
Applications are built by developers.

42
00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:29.690
Developers require access to resources and

43
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.085
data which are exposed by companies through APIs.

44
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:37.495
API products are built and managed by API teams.

45
00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:42.160
API teams coordinate with back end systems to consume data while

46
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.570
creating API that meet the expectations of end users, and application developers.

47
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.940
The Digital Value Chain illustrates not only the interactions that API facilitate,

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.935
but also the key actors.

49
00:02:54.935 --> 00:03:00.055
It represents a reminder of the capabilities that an API platform should provide.

50
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:05.250
With that understanding, let's explore Apigee's core capabilities.

51
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.015
At a high level, Apigee Edge has three core capabilities.

52
00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:15.305
API services provide features related to API management and runtime execution,

53
00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:19.270
building and deploying API proxies as well as the execution of flows

54
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.300
and policies within those proxies falls under API services.

55
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.840
Developer services provide a collection of features to enable

56
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.580
the interaction between the people consuming the APIs and those producing APIs.

57
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.835
Developer portal and monetization are key for API adoption.

58
00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.560
Apigee provides rich and flexible

59
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.100
analytics capabilities that can help address questions by business users,

60
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.210
developers, and operations teams.

61
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.515
APIs are products, managing products requires a clear understanding of their performance,

62
00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:52.015
adoption, and overall behavior.

63
00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:56.410
Using Apigee Edge, you can create API proxies.

64
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.900
A proxy is a collection of XML files and resources that

65
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.355
allow you to describe the request and response flow of an API call.

66
00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:08.600
Policies represent the building blocks of API proxies.

67
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.260
They can be attached to specific points on the request and response flow,

68
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.240
allowing you to model the behavior of

69
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.720
a given API call Apigee Edge offers policies related to traffic management,

70
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.515
mediation, and security as well as extensions.

71
00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.410
The developer portal provides a communication channel.

72
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.650
It is how the team producing APIs that can

73
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.485
interact with the developers consuming those APIs.

74
00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:37.015
The developer portal allows you to publish API specifications and relevant documentation.

75
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:39.910
The portal provides developer self-service for

76
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.150
registering applications and subscribing to API products.

77
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.810
It facilitates API key distribution,

78
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.830
and exposes application specific analytics.

79
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.110
Monetization is a flexible,

80
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.690
easy to use solution to realize the value of your APIs.

81
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.340
Monetization allows you to create different revenue models,

82
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.050
manage billing, and process payments.

83
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.940
Monetization integrates with your developer portal

84
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.690
allowing you to offer and manage plans for your API products.

85
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.070
Apigee's analytics allow you to capture and visualize

86
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.740
contextual data related to API execution,

87
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.240
interactions between APIs and back-end systems,

88
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.270
developers and their apps,

89
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.870
error rates, performance, and latency and customer reporting.

90
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.370
Apigee Edge exposes all of its functionality through APIs.

91
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.925
Those APIs can be used for development as well as operational tasks.

92
00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.505
For example, you can deploy APIs,

93
00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:40.625
create users, and run analytics reports using APIs.

94
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:44.780
The management API is consumed by the Apigee Edge enterprise

95
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.755
UI as well as the installation and upgrade processes.

96
00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:52.395
You can use the management API for offline development,

97
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:56.940
CICD automation, and other operational activities.

98
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.960
By now, you should have a high level understanding of

99
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.495
Apigee's core capabilities and its place within the enterprise.

100
00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:05.430
