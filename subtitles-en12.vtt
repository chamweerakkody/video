00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.725
Hello. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:07.945
we will talk about provisioning organizations and environments in the Apigee platform.

3
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.285
In the previous lessons,

4
00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:12.990
we bootstrapped the hosts in our Apigee planet,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.620
then ran the setup program to configure components

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.730
on each host according to the roles they were assigned.

7
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.790
At this point, all of our Apigee Edge services are installed,

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.455
but we still need to create an organization and environment in order to use the platform.

9
00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:33.710
For this demo, we are going to create an organization named apigee,

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.090
with an environment named prod.

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.595
As with the profile setup process,

12
00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.745
we will use a response file to describe our settings.

13
00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:44.740
That file will be fed to a utility that will do

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.285
the work of provisioning the organization and environment for us.

15
00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:51.550
This is the response file we will be using,

16
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.930
ORG_NAME and ENV_NAME define

17
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.835
the names of the organization and environment we are creating.

18
00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:02.050
They should be lowercase and contain only letters and dashes.

19
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.050
VHOST_PORT is the TCP port on which the router will listen for incoming connections.

20
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.630
The convention is to start at 9001 and count up,

21
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.045
but you can select any unused port above 1023.

22
00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:20.075
VHOST_NAME is simply a label for the virtual host.

23
00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:22.950
The convention is to use default for the plain text

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.745
virtual host and secure for the TLS encrypted virtual host,

25
00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:29.685
but you can use a different name if necessary.

26
00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:33.340
VHOST_ALIAS defines the space separated list of

27
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.725
host names that the router will accept for incoming HTTP requests.

28
00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:40.670
If the router receives an HTTP request with

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.655
a host header that it does not recognize, the request will be dropped.

30
00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:48.280
ORG_ADMIN is the email of the user that should be assigned

31
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.900
to the organization administrator role in this new organization,

32
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.380
the user must already exist.

33
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.505
There are additional variables you can add to this response file

34
00:01:57.505 --> 00:02:00.920
if you wish to create a new user at the time you provision the organization.

35
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.020
See our documentation for full details.

36
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.230
APIGEE_ADMINPW is the password of

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.750
the sysadmin user that will be used to create this organization.

38
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.920
The default sysadmin email is the initial sysadmin user you created at installation time,

39
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.445
but you can define the admin email variable to choose a different sysadmin user.

40
00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:23.125
We have our provisioning response file,

41
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:26.280
the next step is to install the provisioning utility.

42
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.375
All commands described here should be run one time on a single management server.

43
00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:35.630
Since actions taken on any management server affect the planet globally,

44
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.160
you do not need to run them on all management servers or any other component.

45
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.015
As with the Apigee setup utility,

46
00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:45.570
we will use the Apigee service command to install

47
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.310
the Apigee provision utility from the Apigee software repository.

48
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.950
The command is, apigee-service apigee-provision install.

49
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.295
After the provisioning utility is installed,

50
00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:01.685
the full command to set up the organization will be,

51
00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:06.640
apigee-service apigee-provision setup-org -f,

52
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:15.835
and the path to our response file, which is, /temp/apigee/response-org.txt.

53
00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:20.145
Let's put all of this together to provision our organization.

54
00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:26.970
As before, files necessary for the installation are stored in /temp/apigee.

55
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.385
Here, you can see the provisioning response file we will use.

56
00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:37.570
Installing the Apigee provision utility is straightforward and

57
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.205
requires only a download and installation from our Apigee software repository.

58
00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:48.600
Finally, let's run the Apigee provision utility.

59
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.680
The setup-org action will take a moment to run,

60
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.370
and you'll see a lot of output.

61
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.375
Setting up an organization does more than just create the organization,

62
00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.975
environment and virtual host,

63
00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:02.330
it also sets up default organizational roles for users,

64
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.640
assigns an organization administrator,

65
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.110
connects message processors to the environment to

66
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.520
provide API request processing capacity, and much more.

67
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.190
Now that the provisioning process is complete,

68
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.110
we can log into the Apigee Enterprise UI by

69
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.870
accessing host one in a web browser on port 9000.

70
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.905
Log in with the sysadmin credentials you provided in the profile setup response file,

71
00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:30.465
and you'll end up at the Apigee UI dashboard page.

72
00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.715
