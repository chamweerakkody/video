Welcome to the installation module of the Apigee Operations Engineer course. In this module, you will learn how to install the Apigee platform. We will start by discussing the planning process, where you will learn how to design your installation typology. Next, you will learn how to prepare for the installation by provisioning infrastructure and fulfilling prerequisites for the installation. After that, we will dive into the actual installation process. This will involve bootstrapping your hosts, setting up edge profiles, provisioning one or more organizations, and setting up developer portal profiles. Finally, we will explore validation and post installation activities. Let's get started.
